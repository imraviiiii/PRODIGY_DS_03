Title: Unveiling Insights with Decision Tree Classifier in Data Science

Hey Github community! ðŸ‘‹ Just completed a fascinating data science task using a Decision Tree Classifier on a Bank Marketing dataset. ðŸŒ³ Here's a snapshot of the journey:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Started by exploring the dataset, checking for duplicates, null values, and understanding the data's structure.

Visualization: Leveraged histograms, bar plots, and box plots to visually inspect numerical and categorical features, ensuring a solid understanding of the data distribution.

Outlier Handling: Employed box plots to identify outliers and implemented a robust strategy to remove them, ensuring a cleaner dataset.

Correlation Analysis: Explored correlations among features, identified high correlation columns, and performed feature selection to enhance model performance.

Label Encoding: Transformed categorical features into numerical format using Label Encoding, preparing the data for machine learning.

Model Building: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing sets.

Model Evaluation: Utilized metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess the model's effectiveness.

Visualization of Decision Tree: Concluded the journey by visualizing the decision tree structure, providing insights into how the model makes predictions.
